# Neural_Network_Introduction
This is a notebook I created for a workshop I led. It is well suited for independent learning as well (extensive introduction text + many code comments).

It covers
*the structure of basic 2-node neural networks,

*how to create and train a linear regression model with Keras in Python,

*more complex structures like classification models,

*how to create and train a model to identify hand written digits using Keras in Python.

All text, images, and code was created by Joshua Zingale.
